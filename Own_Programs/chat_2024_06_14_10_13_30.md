1. **You**: make me a c program on inverted hollow pattern
2. **ChatGPT**: Sure! Here is a simple C program that prints an inverted hollow pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rows, i, j;

    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &rows);

    for (i = rows; i >= 1; i--) {
        for (j = 1; j <= rows; j++) {
            if (j == i || j == rows || i == 1) {
                printf("*");
            } else {
                printf(" ");
            }
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this program:
1. We first take the number of rows as input from the user.
2. We then use two nested loops to iterate over each row and column position.
3. In the inner loop, we check if the current position should contain a "*" or a space based on the conditions to create the inverted hollow pattern.
4. We print "*" if the condition is met, otherwise we print a space.
5. Finally, we move to the next line after each row is printed.

You can run this program in a C compiler to see the output of the inverted hollow pattern based on the number of rows you provide.

4. **ChatGPT**: Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple C program that will print an inverted hollow pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rows, i, j;

    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &rows);

    for (i = rows; i >= 1; i--) {
        for (j = 1; j <= rows; j++) {
            if (i == 1 || i == rows || j == 1 || j == rows) {
                printf("* ");
            } else {
                printf("  ");
            }
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this program:
1. We first take the number of rows as input from the user.
2. We then use nested loops to iterate over each row and column to print the pattern.
3. If we are at the first row, last row, first column, or last column, we print `*`, else we print a space.

You can run this program in a C compiler to see the output. Feel free to adjust the code as needed to fit your requirements.
